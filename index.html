        This specification defines payment method identifiers and how they are
        validated, and, where applicable, minted and formally registered with
        the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. Other specifications (e.g.,
        the [[[payment-request]]]) make use of these identifiers to facilitate
        monetary transactions on the web platform.

    <section id='sotd' class="updateable-rec">
      <p>
        The working group demonstrates implementation experience by producing
        an <a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/test-results/payment-method-id/all.html">implementation
        report</a>. The report shows two or more independent implementations
        passing each mandatory test in the <a href=
        "https://w3c-test.org/payment-method-id/">test suite</a> (i.e., each
        test corresponds to a MUST requirement of the specification).
      </p>
      <p>
        There has been no change in dependencies on other workings groups
        during the development of this specification.
