      <p>
        The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] requires that merchants supply a list
        of identifiers for supported payment methods. This specification defines those identifier
        strings and how they are created.

      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-method-identifiers/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.
      </p>

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          To use PaymentRequest API, merchants (or their service
	  providers) must know how to handle payment method
	  specific data for those methods they claim to accept.
          This allows the API to abstract away the details of specific
	  payment methods and to add new ones over time without
	  changing the API specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the paymentRequest() call, the Web page provides
	  an array of strings that identify accepted payment methods.
	  This specification defines those strings.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
      <p>This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>URL</dt>
        <dd>The terms <dfn>URL</dfn>, <dfn>absolute URL</dfn>, <dfn>base URL</dfn>, <dfn>URL parser</dfn>, and <dfn>URL equivalence</dfn> are defined by [[!url-1-20141209]] <small><em>(or the editor's draft)</em></small>.</dd>

      <h2>URLs as Payment Method Identifiers</h2>
      <p>When the party
	responsible for a payment method wishes to publish
	machine-readable information associated with the payment
	method, it does so with a URL.
	This URL approach offers at least two benefits: identifier
	decentralization and origins as a trust mechanism.
	In particular, owners of proprietary payment methods
	can use Web servers under their control to publish
	security information about authorized payment apps.</p>
      <div class="issue" title="Payment method manifest specification in progress">The Web Payments Working Group is developing a payment method manifest specification for the information a payment method owner would want to publish. Payment method identifiers that are URLs will help user agents locate these manifest files, although the exact mechanism is not yet defined. See the early <a href="https://github.com/zkoch/zkoch.github.io/blob/master/payment-manifest.md">Payment Manifest Proposal</a>.
	</div>
      <div class="issue" title="URL maintenance and performance">Either in the payment method manifest specification or in separate "good practice" documentation, the Working Group should address issues of server performance for payment method identifiers that are URLs. Furthermore, when parties feel they do not need to publish a manifest, we should explain that a manifest with an explicit machine-readable assertion that "any payment app may implement" is preferable to lack of a manifest.
	</div>
      <section>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
	<p>When URLs are used for payment method identifiers they MUST
	  be absolute URLs including only the schema, origin, and path parts. The URL scheme MUST be <code>https</code>. These URLs MUST NOT include query string parameters or fragment identifiers.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Matching</h3>
        <p>User agents MUST use the following algorithm to determine whether two payment method identifiers that are URLs match:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Let <em>A</em> be the first payment method identifier string and let <em>B</em> be the second payment method
          identifier string.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlA</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when parsing <em>A</em> with
          no <a>base URL</a>.</li>
          <li>Let <em>urlB</em> be the result from the <a>URL parser</a> when parsing <em>B</em> with
          no <a>base URL</a></li>
          <li>The identifiers match if <em>urlA</em> <strong>equals</strong> <em>urlB</em> using the
          <a>URL equivalence</a> test (i.e. the test returns true).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>

        <section>
      <h2>W3C-Defined Strings as Payment Method Identifiers</h2>
      <p>W3C expects to publish a small number of payment method
	specifications that define abstractions across
	similar payment methods (such as credit card payments,
	tokenized payments, or credit transfers). W3C expects these
	payment methods will be implemented in a wide variety of third party
	payment apps. W3C identifies these payment methods with (short) strings; W3C expects to mint these strings in payment method specifications published by the Web Payments Working Group.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
	<p>The syntax of W3C strings used as payment method identifiers is constrained by this regular expression: <code>[a-z0-9-]+</code></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Matching</h3>
        <p>For W3C strings, user agents MUST use exact string matching.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conditional Matching of Payment Methods</h2>
      <p>For some payment methods, merchants may wish to express
	that they accept a payment method but only under certain
	conditions (e.g., "I only credit cards from brand A and
	debit cards from brand B"). The Web Payments Working
	Group has discussed several ways to support more sophisticated
	matching, including:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Parties may mint payment method identifiers to
	  represent different conditions. This scalable approach may work
	  well for a small number of independent conditions, but
	  may not scale well for complex relationships.</li>
	<li>Payment methods may define "filters." Merchants provide
	  filter data as input to the Payment Request API to complement
	  payment method identifier matching.</li>
      </ul>
