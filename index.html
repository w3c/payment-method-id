        This specification defines payment method identifiers and how they are
        validated, and, where applicable, minted and formally registered with
        the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>. Other specifications (e.g.,
        <a data-cite="payment-request">Payment Request</a>) make use of these
        identifiers to facilitate monetary transactions on the web platform.

          The steps to <dfn data-lt="validate|valid">validate a URL-based
          payment method identifier</dfn> are given by the following algorithm.
          The algorithm takes a <var>url</var> <a data-cite=
          "!URL#concept-url">URL</a> as input and returns true if the URL is
          valid:
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>If <var>url</var>'s <a data-cite=
          "!URL#concept-url-scheme">scheme</a> is not "https", return false.

          <li>If <var>url</var>'s <a data-cite=
          "!URL#concept-url-username">username</a> or <a data-cite=
          "!URL#concept-url-password">password</a> is not the empty string,
          return false.

          methods in a machine-processable format. We encourage developers to
          experiment with Payment Manifest by placing one at the <a>URL-based
          payment method identifier</a>'s location, but caution that that
          specification might change in incompatible ways during the
          standardization process. If you'd like to follow along and
