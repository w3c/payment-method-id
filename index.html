        This specification defines payment method identifiers and how they are
        validated, and, where applicable, minted and formally registered with
        the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>. Other specifications (e.g.,
        <a data-cite="payment-request">Payment Request</a>) make use of these
        identifiers to facilitate monetary transactions on the web platform.

          The algorithm takes a <var>url</var> <a data-cite=

          valid:
        </p>

          <li>If <var>url</var>'s <a data-cite=
